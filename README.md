## 📄 Research Paper & Project Overview

This repository hosts the final research paper detailing the methodology and findings of the Depression Sentiment Analysis project. The primary objective was to build and evaluate models capable of classifying text sentiment related to depression.

The paper, titled `Research_Paper`, provides a comprehensive overview of the study, including:
* An introduction to the problem of depression sentiment analysis.
* A literature review on existing methods and models in the field.
* A detailed explanation of the proposed methodology, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
* [cite_start]Analysis of the performance of different machine learning models, such as **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**, on the task of depression detection[cite: 92, 94].
* A discussion of the results and future work.

***Note:** The "Other stuff (Bonus)" material included in this repository is supplementary and may not be identical to the final content of the research paper. It is provided for additional context and transparency.*

## 📊 Dataset

The core of this project relies on a dataset of social media text to train the sentiment analysis models. The `Dataset` directory contains two key files:

* `twitter_training.csv`: The training data used to teach the models how to classify sentiment.
* `twitter_validation.csv`: The validation data used to evaluate the models' performance on unseen data.

[cite_start]The dataset, sourced from Twitter, contains text entries that have been manually classified into different sentiment categories, including those related to depression and anxiety[cite: 92, 94].
